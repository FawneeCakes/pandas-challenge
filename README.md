In this assignment, you’ll create and manipulate Pandas DataFrames to analyze school and standardized test data.

Background
You are the new Chief Data Scientist for your city's school district. In this capacity, you'll be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

As a first task, you've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. You'll be given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Your task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

Written Report:

In my assessment of the school district’s performance, I thoroughly examined standardized test results in both math and reading, school budgets, and grade point averages. I organized this information by school size and type, with a particular focus on district and charter schools.

Key Findings:

Charter Schools vs. District Schools:
Charter schools consistently outperformed district schools in both math and reading scores, as well as the percentage of students passing the exams. This suggests that the charter school model, with its increased independence and adaptability, may lead to improved student outcomes.
School Size Impact:
Smaller schools (those with fewer than 1,000 pupils) demonstrated better average test scores and pass rates compared to larger schools. This trend highlights the potential benefits of a more personalized and supportive learning environment in smaller educational settings.
Overall Insights:

My analysis provides valuable insights into the school district’s performance, pinpointing areas where enhancements can lead to better student outcomes.

Additional Observations:

One intriguing result from my data analysis relates to spending ranges. Schools with lower per-student expenditures tended to have higher overall passing rates. For instance:

Schools spending less than $585 per student achieved an impressive overall passing rate of 90.4%.
In contrast, schools spending between $645 and $680 per student had a significantly lower overall passing rate of only 53.5%.
However, it’s crucial to emphasize that this analysis reveals a correlation, not a causal relationship. Other factors, such as teacher quality, available resources, and school-specific dynamics, may contribute to the differences in passing rates. Additionally, each school’s unique needs may necessitate varying levels of funding to ensure a quality education for all students.
